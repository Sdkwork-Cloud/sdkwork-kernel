## 2. Readiness Matrix (2026-07-11)

Status is evidence-based. "Implementation present" means the authored path
exists; it does not waive the listed verification or target-environment gate.
No row in this matrix by itself authorizes production or GA promotion.

| Area | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace compile/test | **Release gate** | `cargo test --workspace` must pass before release promotion; targeted crate commands are listed in section 5 |
| Provider binding catalog | **Release gate** | `node scripts/check-agent-provider-bindings.mjs` |
| Provider runtime operation contract | **Implementation present; release revalidation required** | Binding manifests declare capability `execution_scope` and backend `runtime_operations`; provider-local lifecycle state exposes only `ping` through transport routing, while lifecycle mutations remain in typed provider-local SPI; provider routing and worker tests must pass in the release revision |
| Transport bootstrap alignment | **Release gate** | Provider crates must use `ProviderTransportBootstrap`; verified by provider binding checks |
| Kernel standards gate | **Release gate** | `node scripts/check-kernel-standards.mjs` |
| Plugin structure contract | **Release gate** | `kernel_plugin_structure.test.mjs` through `pnpm verify` |
| BirdCoder cross-repo alignment | **External gate** | Alignment contract tests run in sibling product repositories |
| Agents runtime facade | **External gate** | `sdkwork-agents-runtime-facade` tests run in the sibling `sdkwork-agents` repository |
| Repository docs Canon | **Release gate** | `check-repository-docs-standard.mjs` |
| Root component contract | **Contract present; standards gate required** | `specs/component.spec.json` declares the kernel service boundary and verification commands |
| Runtime DB SQLite/Postgres parity | **Implementation under release revalidation** | Versioned migrations, SQL-level pagination/filtering, transactions, stable ordering, and idempotent writes are implemented. Live PostgreSQL contracts are explicit ignored tests so credential-free runs cannot report them as executed; `pnpm verify:commercial` requires a disposable live URI and runs the release-selected test with `--ignored`. The full live PostgreSQL suite and target contention/load evidence must pass; SQLite-only evidence is insufficient for production |
| Session concurrent update safety | **Implementation present; live PostgreSQL revalidation required** | SQLite, PostgreSQL, and memory updates preserve database-owned `message_count`, owner identity, and `created_at`; unknown-session updates fail instead of upserting. SQLite stale-row contracts cover ordinary and event-transaction updates |
| Runtime health HTTP contract | **Implementation present; contract gate required** | Internal runtime health uses SDKWork v3 success or `ProblemDetail`; HTTP contract tests remain mandatory |
| Infrastructure probes | **Implementation present; failure drills required** | Framework `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/livez` are present. Readiness checks persistence/schema drift, production required-provider health, and cloud-production rate-limit/idempotency Redis using shared connection managers; target failover and outage drills remain promotion evidence |
| Runtime bridge isolation and bounded cleanup | **Implementation present; stress revalidation required** | Session turn-lock registry uses weak ownership with deterministic final-user cleanup; 30 repeated serialization/drain runs and workspace tests pass. Hydration is bounded to 64 recent messages and 16 MiB, catalogs reject more than 200 entries, and existing stream/history global budgets remain enforced; target load/soak evidence is still required |
| Production mock override gate | **Implementation present; release gate required** | Production preflight rejects `SDKWORK_KERNEL_ALLOW_MOCK_PROVIDERS`; provider and transport tests must prove no synthetic fallback remains |
| Provider worker synthetic operation gate | **Implementation under release revalidation** | Node/Python/Rust transport tests must prove production request-scoped cancellation, bounded IPC, and fail-closed behavior without synthetic operation results |
| Internal-api pagination envelope | **Implementation present; contract tests required** | Session/message/task lists are cursor-only: the first request omits `cursor`, continuations pass through `pageInfo.nextCursor`, signed resource-scoped cursors carry `(sort_key,id)`, strict `page_size` is `1..=200`, and tamper, deleted-anchor continuity, bounded-query, and SQLite/PostgreSQL parity tests are release evidence |
| Pagination cursor key isolation | **Implementation present; rotation drill required** | Cursor HMAC uses only `SDKWORK_CURSOR_SIGNING_SECRET`. Production preflight requires at least 32 bytes and rejects reuse of ingress, JWT, or metrics credentials. Tests prove unrelated credential rotation preserves cursors and cursor-key rotation invalidates them. Secret-manager injection and a controlled rotation drill remain release evidence |
| Distributed rate-limit and quota fail-closed | **Implementation present; failure drills required** | Redis-backed enforcement, awaited invoke reconciliation, supervised stream reconciliation through success/failure/disconnect, and Redis outage behavior must pass targeted tests and staging failure drills |
| Live official SDK invokes | **Optional (merge)** | `engine-sdk-live.test.mjs` is the credential-free resolver/fail-closed merge contract and does not treat unbuilt `external/` source mirrors as live SDK packages; commercial release uses `pnpm verify:commercial` instead |
| Staging CI live SDK/gateway gate | **Required release input; environment evidence required** | `kernel-staging-live-sdk.yml`, provider credentials/endpoints, and Hermes gateway proof must pass for the selected release revision |
| Commercial release verification | **Release gate wired into packaging** | `sdkwork.workflow.json` runs `pnpm verify:commercial` before package creation; commercial release verification fails closed unless `SDKWORK_AGENT_RUNTIME_POSTGRES_URI` reaches live runtime PostgreSQL, staging SDK credentials or gateway endpoints are available for the selected provider proofs, and Hermes-specific staging gateway proof passes |
| Tool discovery and policy enforcement | **Implementation present; live approval proof pending** | Production/default bridges advertise only descriptors returned by a registered provider; mock tools are test-constructor-only. Invocation and durable approval resume use `ToolExecutionService`, re-evaluate policy before provider side effects, and reject changed permission identity/provider/descriptor/policy revisions. Live provider and fault-injection evidence remains a release blocker |
| Session execution timeout | **Implementation present; provider soak evidence pending** | `timeoutMs` is validated to `100..=3600000`, persisted in session metadata, and propagated into typed model requests. JSON model/tool calls use a bounded blocking admission pool configured by `SDKWORK_PROVIDER_MAX_CONCURRENCY` (`64` default, `1..=1024`). Managed Node/Python stdio unary and streaming calls enforce a hard process deadline; expiry kills, waits for, and retires only the request-scoped worker. Provider-specific cancellation latency, long-running soak, and resource-ceiling evidence remain release gates |
| Provider admission observability | **Implementation present; alert/load evidence pending** | Synchronous model, tool, message-turn, and SSE provider paths share one bounded admission executor. Execution defaults to 64 active calls; the independently bounded wait queue defaults to 64 and times out after 5 seconds. A typed admission lease is required before bounded session-history hydration, preventing rejected requests from allocating up to the hydration budget first. Queue-full/timeout failures use retryable provider-unavailable errors. `/metrics` exposes fixed-series execution/wait capacity, active, waiting, rejection-reason, and acquisition-latency families. Lifecycle accounting covers cancellation, error, and panic paths without request/session/tenant labels. Target dashboards, alert thresholds, and saturation load evidence remain release inputs |
| Persistence admission and OOM bound | **Implementation present; load evidence pending** | All server persistence work, including API operations, SSE durable recovery, health access, and cleanup, shares a bounded blocking admission executor. Defaults are 64 active operations, 128 waiters, and a two-second admission timeout; startup bounds are strict and configurable. Queue-full/timeout/closed paths fail with standard service-unavailable problems. `/metrics` exposes fixed-series capacity, active, waiting, rejection, and acquisition-latency families. Target database-pool saturation and memory-ceiling evidence remains mandatory |
| SSE event connection admission | **Implementation present; cluster fan-out evidence pending** | The 256-stream per-process permit is acquired before session lookup, broadcast subscription, and durable replay, so saturated requests cannot allocate replay vectors or issue persistence reads. Output and deduplication buffers remain bounded. Durable recovery polling exponentially backs off from one to five seconds while idle and resets after activity or lag. A shared cross-pod notification transport and target-cluster slow-consumer/disconnect/fan-out evidence remain required before commercial scale claims |
| Permission state consistency | **Implementation present; production evidence pending** | SQLite/PostgreSQL v5 stores atomically persist permission execution context, AES-256-GCM ciphertext, revision bindings, expiry, lease, and fencing state. Allow/deny/expiry and terminal crypto-erasure are transactional; a bounded worker revalidates policy/revisions and resumes with the original tool-call id. SQLite and end-to-end contracts pass; live PostgreSQL contention, key rotation, provider idempotency, restart/failure injection, and load evidence remain P0 release gates |
| Runtime task execution | **Partial implementation; multi-step execution pending** | Async submit, durable task/run/step state, leases/fencing, retry/control APIs, and a bounded real model worker are implemented. The current worker completes one model-call step and explicitly fails rather than fabricating requested tool steps. Durable planner integration, multi-step dependency/reconciliation, retry classification/backoff, provider request-id persistence, and real in-flight cancellation remain P0 |
| Production data plane HA | **Target-environment release gate** | Managed HA Postgres/Redis, exact NetworkPolicy egress, backup/restore, failover, node/zone loss, and capacity evidence are mandatory; bundled data manifests are local/staging only |
| Target-scoped release package evidence | **Local pipeline implementation present; publication pending** | Package-scoped SBOM/checksum validation exists; immutable registry digest, provenance/attestation, and published rollback evidence are still required |
| Published artifact registry | **Pending** | Target package evidence is local/CI validated; external registry publication and signed checksum records remain in [REQ-2026-0001](../requirements/REQ-2026-0001-commercial-hardening.md) |
| MiMo Code production path | **Pending** | See REQ-2026-0001 |
| IM agent surfaces via agents only | **In progress** | See REQ-2026-0001 |
| Provider subprocess true streaming | **Implementation present; soak gate required** | Incremental NDJSON/SSE, bounded backpressure, unique success/error terminal events, quota reconciliation, and capacity release paths require provider-specific cancellation, slow-consumer, disconnect, and long-running soak evidence |
| Env/file + Vault secret backends | **Implementation present; deployment evidence required** | Secret provider code exists; production must prove external injection, rotation, least privilege, and no checked-in/default credential |
| Enterprise GA readiness | **Not ready** | Artifact publication, full commercial verification, composed dependency readiness, managed HA/failover/restore/load evidence, and external sibling-repository gates remain mandatory |

Commercial status: **not approved for production or GA**. A controlled commercial
pilot is permitted only after all repository gates pass on the exact revision
and the target environment supplies managed HA PostgreSQL/Redis, immutable
artifacts, secret isolation, NetworkPolicy, restore/failover/load evidence,
provider live proof, and external sibling-repository gates. Missing evidence is
a failed gate, not an accepted technical debt item.

## 3. Phase Roadmap

| Checked-in/default production credentials | 0 |
| Production image identity | 100% immutable digest |
| Managed data-service restore and failover drills | 100% passed for the release environment |
| Pagination/store query bounds | 100% of list/search paths bounded at the authoritative store |
| Capacity evidence | Load and soak targets pass without OOM, unbounded queue growth, or deadlock |

## 5. Verification Commands

Workspace verification: [TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md §9](../../architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md#9-verification).

### Kernel repository

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
node scripts/check-agent-provider-bindings.mjs
node scripts/check-kernel-standards.mjs
node ../../../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-repository-docs-standard.mjs --root .
pnpm verify
pnpm verify:commercial
pnpm test:topology
```

`pnpm verify:commercial` is a release-promotion gate, not the default developer merge gate. It fails closed unless `SDKWORK_AGENT_RUNTIME_POSTGRES_URI` points at live runtime PostgreSQL, staging SDK credentials or gateway endpoints are configured for the live provider check, and `SDKWORK_KERNEL_STAGING_HERMES_GATEWAY=1` enables the Hermes-specific staging gateway proof. For OpenClaw, both `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` and `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` are required; unauthenticated gateway execution is rejected.

### Cross-repository

```bash
cargo test -p sdkwork-agents-runtime-facade
cargo test -p sdkwork-birdcoder-kernel-bridge
node scripts/kernel-birdcoder-alignment-contract.test.mjs
```
