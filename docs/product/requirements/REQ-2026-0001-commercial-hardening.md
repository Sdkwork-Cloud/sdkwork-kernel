# REQ-2026-0001: Commercial Hardening (P4)

```yaml
id: REQ-2026-0001
title: Complete kernel commercial hardening for P4 release
owner: SDKWork kernel maintainers
status: in-progress
source: platform
problem: Kernel mechanism paths are under active verification, but enterprise rollout is not approved until artifact publishing, strict commercial release verification, live runtime PostgreSQL evidence, Hermes-specific staging gateway proof, managed HA data-plane controls, immutable secrets/images, MiMo Code facade/live SDK proof, and IM agents-only consumption are evidenced on the release revision.
goals:
  - Publish kernel server binaries to artifact registry with checksum/SBOM evidence
  - Keep the default merge pipeline credential-free while making commercial release verification fail closed on missing live dependencies
  - Require `pnpm verify:commercial` to validate live runtime PostgreSQL, staging SDK credentials, and Hermes-specific staging gateway proof before release promotion
  - Require production deployments to use managed HA Postgres and managed HA Redis, not bundled single-node reference manifests
  - Require production deployments to inject secrets externally, use a dedicated metrics credential, apply exact NetworkPolicy egress, and deploy immutable image digests
  - Require target-environment load, memory, cancellation, failover, restore, and graceful-shutdown evidence before commercial promotion
  - Complete MiMo Code agents facade registration and staging live SDK proof
  - Route IM PC agent surfaces exclusively through sdkwork-agents SDK
non_goals:
  - P5 ZeroClaw, gRPC client, dynamic plugins, discovery
  - Product business features in sdkwork-kernel
users:
  - SRE / release engineer
  - Platform engineer
  - IM PC and BirdCoder product teams
acceptance_criteria:
  - Release pipeline builds target-scoped linux-x64 tar.gz and windows-x64 zip server packages, and validates package-scoped checksum/SBOM evidence from sdkwork.app.config.json
  - Release validation rejects legacy crate-scoped `sdkwork-agent-server` evidence that is not tied to manifest package ids
  - Default merge verification remains credential-free, while `pnpm verify:commercial` runs `scripts/verify-kernel-audit-remediation.mjs --commercial-release`
  - Commercial release verification fails closed when `SDKWORK_AGENT_RUNTIME_POSTGRES_URI` is missing, staging SDK credentials are not available, or `SDKWORK_KERNEL_STAGING_HERMES_GATEWAY=1` is not set
  - Commercial release verification forces `SDKWORK_KERNEL_STAGING_LIVE_SDK=1` and `SDKWORK_KERNEL_STAGING_REQUIRE_CREDENTIALS=1` for the staging SDK gate
  - Commercial release verification runs `scripts/provider-transport-workers/hermes-gateway-staging.mjs` for the Hermes TUI gateway JSON-RPC proof
  - TypeScript and Python provider transport workers fail closed for synthetic `session_create`, `model_chat` probe fallbacks, `tool_invoke`, `skill_invoke`, and unknown operations in production when mock fallback is disabled
  - Rust IPC/Node/Python provider transport stubs and injected transports fail closed in production when mock fallback is disabled
  - Production runbooks require managed HA Postgres and managed HA Redis; `deployments/kubernetes/postgres-redis.yaml` is documented as local/staging reference only
  - Production runbooks reject checked-in/default credentials, metrics-token reuse, mutable image tags, broad database egress, and unbounded deployment claims
  - bindings/agent-providers/mimo-code/provider-binding.manifest.json validates and MiMo Code registers in sdkwork-agents-runtime-facade
  - sdkwork-im has zero direct dependency on sdkwork-agent-provider-* crates
non_functional_requirements:
  security: none beyond SECURITY_SPEC.md and production mock policy
  privacy: none beyond root standards
  performance: none beyond root standards
  reliability: commercial release verification uses live runtime PostgreSQL plus Hermes-specific staging gateway proof, production uses managed HA Postgres and managed HA Redis, and artifact rollback, restore/failover, load, memory, and NetworkPolicy evidence is documented per RELEASE_SPEC.md and DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md

## Rollout Items

1. CI publishing of kernel server binaries to artifact registry with signed checksums.
2. Target-scoped package evidence: lifecycle package builds the declared tar.gz/zip package, SBOM/checksum/signing policy live under `dist/release/<package-id>/`, and release validation rejects evidence that is not tied to manifest package ids.
3. Commercial release gate via `pnpm verify:commercial`; it requires `SDKWORK_AGENT_RUNTIME_POSTGRES_URI`, `SDKWORK_KERNEL_STAGING_LIVE_SDK=1`, `SDKWORK_KERNEL_STAGING_REQUIRE_CREDENTIALS=1`, and `SDKWORK_KERNEL_STAGING_HERMES_GATEWAY=1`.
4. Staging-backed live SDK invoke gate via `kernel-staging-live-sdk.yml` (`workflow_dispatch`, credential-gated), plus Hermes TUI gateway JSON-RPC proof via `hermes-gateway-staging.mjs`.
5. Production data-plane handoff to managed HA Postgres and managed HA Redis; bundled Kubernetes Postgres/Redis remains local/staging only.
6. Complete MiMo Code agents facade registration and staging live SDK proof.
7. IM PC agent module exclusively via `sdkwork-agents` SDK.
8. Multi-region runtime DB failover runbook (product-owned; kernel documents session recovery SPI only).
