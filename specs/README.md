# SDKWork Kernel Specifications

This directory contains the SDKWork Agent and Code Kernel standards. The Agent
Kernel defines the general runtime and provider foundation. The Code Kernel
builds on that foundation with software-engineering-specific SPI for
workspaces, VCS, patches, terminal execution, verification, language
intelligence, review, artifacts, and the code-agent runtime registry.

Runtime connectivity profiles for local dev and deployment live in
[`topology.spec.json`](./topology.spec.json) with env files under
`../configs/topology/`. See [`../docs/topology-standard.md`](../docs/topology-standard.md).

## Platform Framework Alignment

| Framework | Status | Integration point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sdkwork-web-framework` | **Integrated** | Workspace `Cargo.toml` deps (`sdkwork-web-core`, `sdkwork-web-axum`, `sdkwork-web-bootstrap`, `sdkwork-iam-web-adapter`); route crates under `crates/sdkwork-router-agent-*` wrap served routers with `with_web_request_context`. Verified by `tools/validators/kernel-standards/platform-integration.mjs`. |
| `sdkwork-database` | **Integrated** | Workspace deps (`sdkwork-database-config`, `sdkwork-database-sqlx`); `sdkwork-agent-business` `postgres-sync` bootstraps pools through `BlockingPostgresPool`. Verified by `platform-integration.mjs` and `agent_postgres_sync_contracts`. |
| `sdkwork-utils` | **Integrated** | Workspace dep `sdkwork-utils-rust` in `validation.rs` and `postgres_sync_pool.rs`; persistence storage validation delegates to `require_trimmed_non_blank`; kernel UI consumes `@sdkwork/utils`. Verified by `scripts/dev/sdkwork-kernel-utils-standard.test.mjs`. |
| `sdkwork-discovery` | **Deferred** | Kernel has no first-party gRPC/RPC services. Adopt when an RPC surface ships per `RPC_SPEC.md` and `RUST_RPC_SPEC.md`. |
| PNPM script surface | **Integrated** | Root `package.json` exposes `dev`, `build`, `test`, `check`, `verify`, `clean` via `scripts/sdkwork-command.mjs`. Verified by `tools/validators/kernel-standards/platform-pnpm-scripts.mjs`. |

Sibling checkout and release refs are declared in `sdkwork.workflow.json`
(`sdkwork-web-framework`, `sdkwork-database`, `sdkwork-utils`).

## Reading Order

1. Start with [`../README.md`](../README.md) for the industry-level kernel
   positioning.
2. Read [`../sdkwork-agent-kernel/README.md`](../sdkwork-agent-kernel/README.md)
   for the Agent Kernel implementation boundary.
3. Read [`AGENT_KERNEL_SPEC.md`](./AGENT_KERNEL_SPEC.md).
4. Read [`AGENT_MANIFEST_SPEC.md`](./AGENT_MANIFEST_SPEC.md) before implementing
   agents, providers, adapters, or registries.
5. Read [`AGENT_INSTALLATION_CONFIGURATION_SPEC.md`](./AGENT_INSTALLATION_CONFIGURATION_SPEC.md)
   before implementing agent package installers or agent configuration screens.
6. Read [`CODE_KERNEL_SPEC.md`](./CODE_KERNEL_SPEC.md) before implementing
   code-agent workspace, patch, terminal, verification, language, review, or
   artifact providers.
7. Read the provider, runtime, security, telemetry, UI, and conformance specs
   relevant to the implementation profile.

## Standard Closure Checklist

- [ ] Every provider has a manifest.
- [ ] Every executable agent has an `AgentDefinition` that binds model, tool,
      context, memory, policy, and other SPI provider families by provider id
      when those families are required or selected by default.
- [ ] Every code provider has a typed SPI registration path or is explicitly
      manifest-only.
- [ ] Every installable agent has installer, uninstall, upgrade, and
      configuration contracts.
- [ ] Every runtime can produce a capability manifest.
- [ ] Every runtime can produce diagnostics for typed providers,
      manifest-only providers, provider health, degraded capabilities, and
      missing standard provider families.
- [ ] Every runtime can produce standard `runtime-manifest` and
      `runtime-local` conformance reports from diagnostics.
- [ ] Every runtime that claims model catalog support exposes
      `model.catalog`, `ModelDescriptor`, and request-level `model_id`
      selection through the Model provider SPI.
- [ ] Every runtime that claims MCP support exposes `mcp.tools`,
      `mcp.resources`, or `mcp.prompts` through the MCP provider SPI.
- [ ] Every runtime that claims Agent Skills support exposes `skill.discover`
      and `skill.invoke` through the Agent Skill provider SPI.
- [ ] Every runtime that claims RAG or knowledge retrieval support exposes
      `knowledge.search`, `knowledge.read`, and/or `knowledge.list` through the
      Knowledge provider SPI rather than binding directly to a vector store.
- [ ] Every code runtime can produce diagnostics for typed providers,
      manifest-only providers, health, and missing standard families.
- [ ] Every code runtime can produce deterministic manifest and local-runtime
      conformance reports.
- [ ] Every generic kernel and code manifest/report contract has a
      machine-readable schema.
- [ ] Every plugin compatibility claim is backed by `KernelPluginManifest`,
      declared provider/adapter contributions, and a conformance profile.
- [ ] Every protected action flows through policy.
- [ ] Every side-effectful code operation can build a standard
      `PolicyRequest`.
- [ ] Every long-running operation is event-backed and cancellable where
      supported.
- [ ] Every adapter maps external protocol objects to SDKWork kernel objects.
- [ ] Every code object required by UI/IPC/RPC maps to a shared protocol
      envelope with namespaced metadata.
- [x] Every UI package uses typed clients/service adapters.
- [x] Runtime HTTP uses canonical internal-api paths only (retired `/api/kernel/*` guarded).
- [x] Production deployment reference assets exist under `deployments/` (Docker, Kubernetes, runbook).
- [x] Release supply-chain evidence includes SBOM and checksum validation scripts.
- [ ] Every compatibility claim is backed by a conformance profile.
